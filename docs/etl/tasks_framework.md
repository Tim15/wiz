# Wiz Tasks Framework

The WTF reference implementation is written in Go and has APIs to interface with orchestrators including Kubernetes, Docker, and local environments.

## Implementation
The internal API's are built on `gonum`s graph APIs because of their strong existing support for serialization and deserialization, especially to images and visualizations.
