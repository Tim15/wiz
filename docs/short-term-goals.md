# The Wiz Project

Wiz is a package manager for AI and ML projects and a set of associated libraries for dealing with common problems.

This is an ambitious project, so I've outlined a set of goals for v0.1.0:

* [x] build out the core Wiz Pipelines API
* [ ] build the Wiz Processor API and implement the following basic builtin processors:
* [ ] HTTP File + crawl download
* [ ] Git download/checkout
* [ ] Decompression/extraction of multiple formats
* [ ] SQL and
* [ ] FoundationDB loaders
* [ ] Build a basic Wiz Packages API that incorporates Wiz Pipelines for data packages
