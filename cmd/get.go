Requires an output.yaml file to actually output anything, else the DAG won't be executed.
Only works for "type: data" packages.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command

	// getCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// getCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
	getCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&outfile, "output", "o", "", "The output specification file (required)")
